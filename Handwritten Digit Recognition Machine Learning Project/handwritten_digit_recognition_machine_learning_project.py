 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database

# Overview

This notebook contains the code and materials for a machine learning assignment focused on analyzing the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Google Colab. The Project aims to assess proficiency in advanced machine learning techniques, the ability to critically evaluate research methodologies, and effectiveness in collaborative data analysis tasks. These objectives are essential for demonstrating mastery in these areas.

# Dataset
The MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9), is used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## The Data source is kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset

# Dataset Location
The dataset was uploaded to Google Drive and is located in the mnist_dataset folder.

## The folder contains the following files:

train-images-idx3-ubyte: Training images file

train-labels-idx1-ubyte: Training labels file
